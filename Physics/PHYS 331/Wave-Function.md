# Wave Function
## Author: Rohan Singh
This chapter deals with the fundamentals of quantum mechanics which revolve around interpreting wave functions and the other basic building blocks of quantum mechanics.

## Schrödinger's Equation
In classical mechanics, we deal with interpreting (in one-dimension) the expression for the position of a body with respect ot time, i.e. $x(t)$. Through this we can obtain other derived quantities such as velocity,  momentum, kinetic energy etc. We can obtain the position funcion in classical mechanics by solving **Newton's Laws of Motion**.

We will use the same analogy for quantum mechanics where we wish to  obtain the wavefunction of a particle $\Psi(x,t)$ by solving **Schrödinger's Equation**:
$$i\bar{h}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\bar{h}}{2m}\frac{\partial^2\Psi}{\partial x^2}+V\Psi$$

## Interpretation of Wave Functions
In the analogy that I gave above, it was very easy for us too understand the physical meaning of position in the classical mechanics example. But what exactly does a wave function give us?
