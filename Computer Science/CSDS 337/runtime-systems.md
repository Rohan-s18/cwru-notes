## Storage Organization

This is how run-time memory is divided into areas:
  - **Static:** Some program data objects: global constants, and data
generated by the compiler: support garbage collection, may be
known at compile time.
  - **Stack storage:** Names local to a procedure are allocated space
on a stack
  - **Heap storage:** Data that may outlive the call to the procedure
that created it is usually allocated on a â€œheap" of reusable
storage.

## Procedures

A procedure is **activated** when called.

The **lifetime** of an activation of a procedure is the sequence of steps
between the first and last steps in the execution of the procedure
body.

A procedure is **recursive** if a new activation can begin before an
earlier activation of the same procedure has ended.

## Parameter Passing Modes
Theseare some parameter passing techniques:  
  - Call-by-value: evaluate actual parameters and enter r-values in
activation record
  - Call-by-reference: enter pointer to the storage of the actual
parameter
  - Copy-restore (aka value-result): evaluate actual parameters and enter
r-values, after the call copy r-values of formal parameters into actuals
  - Call-by-name: use a form of in-line code expansion to evaluate
parameters
