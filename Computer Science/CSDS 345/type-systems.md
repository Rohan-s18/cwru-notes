# Type Systems
## Author: Rohan Singh

How do define a **type** in a programming language?  
  - A type is a set of legal values.  
  - A primitive type of the language or a compound type built up from primitive types.  
  - All the legal operations for the value of the type.  

The type system of a language is defined by:
  - Type equivalence  
  - Type compatibility  
  - Type inference
